This part is used for perparing data into the well trained model, first, we get a csv file which contains Lyft price, the data structure is like the data_demo.csv, then run get_point.py to generate the longtitude and latitude in the csv, then run get_tirp_dis&dur.py to get trip_distance and trip_duration from google distance matrix api, finally, run rearrange.py to rearrange the data order to fit the format of model.
After getting the price from model, run add_price.py to add price to csv file.
projection.csv is need when getting lontitude and latitude point from location id and this csv file is included.
When getting experiment data, run rush_hour.py, this will generate four csv file, which can be used for comparison rush hour and non-rush hour. Then run weekday.py to generate two csv file in weekday experiment. 
When generating experiment data, google may block our request if request too frequently. In this case, the parameter i in the for loop can be reduced, and run the rush_hour.py, weekday.py repeatedly. If you need to run them repeatedly, remember to modify the csv.write mode to 'a', and delete the write title row to avoid write the title repeatedly in the csv.
